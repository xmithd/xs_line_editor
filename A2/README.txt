Assignment 2

A Makefile is provided for convenience.
run 'make all' in this directory to build the 'led' executable.
To run led, simply execute the executable:
./led file_name

Note: To respect the philosphy of the editor, all the commands
will accept range operations as mentioned in the requirements.
However, for 'move up' and 'move down', only the 'starting range'
is taken into account as the number of lines to move. Thus, the
'end range' value is ignored making
4,12341298521093481029341u a valid command for 'move up by 4 lines'.
'$' and '.' (dot) markers make no sense for these commands and
will not be accepted.
Additionally, the command to 'move up by 1 line'
can be issued with just 'u'. 1u will work as well of course.
Similarly, 'move down by 1 line' can be done with
either the enter key, '1d' or simply 'd'.
